  ## Description

  This is a Flash Card app built with Python using the tkinter module for the UI.  It randomly chooses from a list of French words and after 3 seconds will flip to the opposite side of the card to show the English translation.   The user can let the app know when a word is known, so it removes it from the list of words to learn.
